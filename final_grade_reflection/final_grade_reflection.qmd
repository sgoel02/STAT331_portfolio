I believe my final grade should be an A. I am working hard to make sure I understand the concepts we are learning and applying them to every assignment, and I make sure to submit all labs and challenges with my full effort.

Learning Targets:

WD-1, R-1, R-2 ---\> Lab 3

WD-2, WD-3 ---\> Lab 3, Question 8

WD-4 ---\> Lab 3, Question 6

WD-5, WD-6 --\> Lab 4, Questions 5 & 6

WD-7 ---\> Lab 4, Questions 6 & 7

DVS-1 --\> Lab 5, Questions 4 & 5

DVS-2 ---\> Lab 5, Question 4

DVS-3 ---\> Challenge 7, Part 3

DVS-4 ---\> Lab 4, Question 3

DVS-5 ---\> Lab 4, Question 6

DVS-6, DVS-7, PE-1, PE-4 --\> Challenge 9, Question 9

PE-2, PE-3, R-3 ---\> Challenge 8, Questions 2 & 3

DSM-1 ---\> Practice Activity 9, Part 3

DSM-2 ---\> Practice Activity 9, Part 1

Continued Learning:

I am still working on creating professional looking analysis and am continuing to make sure my code only outputs what the readers need to see, rather than just my one debugging process. In this process I have learned to find summaries of different variables and groups, as summarizing all of the variables or groups in the output is not a final solution to the problem, and it is important that the output contains only the information that we are interested in knowing. I have showed revision and continued learning in these topics in my Lab 4, Question 4 in which I produced output that gives the one correct maximum value as opposed to before, when I was printing the summaries of all of the variables in descending order to find the maximum.

Another example of a revision I made with a thoughtful reflection is in Lab 2, Question 2. The revision requested as well as my reflection and correction are in the Quarto file for the lab.

Peer Review / Teamwork:

I have been working very collaboratively with my team all quarter. I often contribute to group discussions about the best way to solve a problem, and together we evaluate which solutions are the most efficient. I give feedback in peer reviews for lab, making sure to include both positive and constructive comments sandwiched together to provide helpful but still overall supportive feedback. This can be seen in the screenshot of my comment for the lab 2 assigned peer review.
